# WIP
## Getting started
+ You will need a [newsapi]( https://newsapi.org/ ) api key and a [alphavantage]( https://www.alphavantage.co/ ) api key.
+ When you first run the app it will generate a `config.json` file in `xdg_config_home`/nfetch in which you put your api key and configure all the sources.
## Usage
+ nfetch outputs to stdout and to a specified html file in `config.json`

## TODO
+ formatted output to stdout
+ use web scrapers instead of apis
